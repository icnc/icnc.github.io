<h2 class="sectionHeading"><a name="_Toc318971091"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>Intel&reg; Concurrent Collections for C++ is a new language for describing parallel computations. It distinguishes the expression of the potential parallelism of the program from both the lower-level serial details of the algorithm, and the actual parallelism for a given target. It works on shared and distributed memory.</p>
<p>These release notes describe the supported platforms; installation instructions; functionality added, changed, and removed, and known issues and possible workarounds for those issues for Intel&reg; Concurrent Collections for C++ since the previous release.</p>

<h2 class="sectionHeading"><a name="_Toc318971092"></a>Supported Platforms</h2>
<p>Microsoft Windows* 7 or newer (embedded editions not supported) or Linux running on intel64 processor architecture.</p>
<p>Since version 1.0 Intel(R) Concurrent Collections for C++ is also availe as open source from <a href="https://github.com/icnc/icnc">github</a></p>

<h2 class="sectionHeading"><a name="_Toc318971093"></a>Installation Notes</h2>
<p>Please see the <a href="index.html?nav=Getting_Started.html">Getting Started</a> document for information on installing the product, and other requirements.</p>

<h2 class="sectionHeading"><a name="_Toc318971094"></a>Restrictions</h2>
<p>The following restrictions apply to this version of the release of this product:</p>
<p>The WhatIf release of Intel&reg; Concurrent Collections for C++ should not be used in production code. Please contact <a href="index.html?nav=Getting_Started.html/#Report_Problems_or_Leave_Feedback">technical support</a> if you are interested in using Intel&reg; Concurrent Collections for C++ in production code.</p>
<p>Follow on releases of this product will likely require rewriting of some of your code. Backward compatibility is not guaranteed.</p>

<h2 class="sectionHeading"><a name="_Toc318971101"></a>Known Problems and Limitations</h2>
<p>This is a list of the known problems of the current implementation.</p>
<p><b>Problem:</b> When running on distributed memory, the default scheduler (TBB_TASK) might react incorrectly to setting the number of threads (CNC_NUM_THREADS)<br /><b>Workaround:</b> Use CNC_SCHEDULER=FIFO_STEAL</p>
<p><b>Problem:</b> Using DAPL with MPI might lead to crashes, dead-locks or bad performance. Newer versions of Intel MPI might provide fixes.<br />
<b>Workarounds:</b>
<ol type="a">
<li> At runtime, set environment variables I_MPI_DAPL_TRANSLATION_CACHE=off and I_MPI_DAPL_CREATE_CONN_QUAL=0
<li>Use TCP by setting environment variables (at runtime) I_MPI_FABRICS=shm:tcp and I_MPI_TCP_NETMASK=ib and I_MPI_DYNAMIC_CONNECTION=0
</ol></p>
<p><b>Problem:</b> CnC::parallel_for does not work with older Microsoft* compilers, the compiler issues error messages.<br />
<b>Workaround:</b> Use the Intel&reg; C++ compiler or use tbb::parallel_for.</p>
<p><b>Problem:</b> When unsing SOCKETS for distributed memory on Windows*, the runtime issues errors related to insufficient memory for the socket communication.<br /><b>Workarounds:</b>
<ol type="a">
<li> Use MPI
<li> Add more memory (RAM)
<li> Use Linux*
</ol></p>
